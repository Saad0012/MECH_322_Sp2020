    "\n",
    "Use commands from the `adafruit_circuitplayground` modules to control the lighting of all 10 NeoPixels. Define each of the following functions before starting your main loop. Inside the main loop call each of the functions in order with a delay setting of 0.75 for each. Use `cp.pixels.auto_write = False` so you have to explicitly control the showing of changes with `cp.pixels.show()`. Use any color of your choosing for the NeoPixels and use the same color for all functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions**\n",
    "- `one_at_a_time(delay)` - Turn on one NeoPixel at a time starting with 0 and ending with 9. After turning on a NeoPixel, delay by the value of the function argument then turn it back off. Use a `for` loop.\n",
    "- `one_after_another(delay)` - Turn on one NeoPixel at a time starting with 0 and ending with 9 until all 10 are on. Delay between turning each on based on the value of the function argument. Once all NeoPixels are on, turn them off one at a time starting with 9 and ending with 0. Delay between turning each off based on the value of the function argument. Use separate `for` loops for turning on and turning off.\n",
    "- `ping_pong(delay)` - Similar to `one_at_a_time(delay)` except after turning on NeoPixels from 0 to 9, turn them on from 9 to 0. There should only ever be one NeoPixel on at a time. Use two separate `for` loops.\n",
    "- `marquee(delay)` - Start by turning on NeoPixels 0 and 5 for the amount of time set by the function argument. Then turn off 0 and 5 and turn on and off 1 and 6 in the same way. Continue incrementing until the pair 4 and 9 have been turned on and off. Use a single `for` loop and indexing to accomplish this task.\n",
    "- `random_lights(delay)` - This function has been defined already. It will randomly turn on and off 10 NeoPixels, keeping them on for the delay time."
